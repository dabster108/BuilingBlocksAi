NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

Key Features
N-dimensional Arrays: ndarray for handling multi-dimensional data.

Mathematical Operations: Linear algebra, statistics, and more.

Broadcasting: Perform operations on arrays of different shapes.

Performance: Faster than standard Python lists due to optimized C-based implementations.

Installation
You can install NumPy using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy
Basic Usage
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np  

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  
print(arr)  

# Array operations
print(arr * 2)  # Multiply each element by 2  
print(np.mean(arr))  # Calculate mean  
NumPy is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. Mastering NumPy will help you work efficiently with numerical data in Python.
